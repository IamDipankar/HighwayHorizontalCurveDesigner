# Highway Horizontal Curve Calculator

This application provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the parameters required for setting a horizontal curve of a highway. The tool is designed to be user-friendly and accessible for highway engineers, students, and professionals in road design and construction.

## Features

- **Curve Calculations**: Compute horizontal curve parameters such as radius, curve length, tangent length, and mid-ordinate.
- **Input Flexibility**: Accepts basic parameters such as design speed, road deflection angle, velocity, and other necessary values.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A streamlined interface for quick and easy input and output.

## How It Works

The app performs calculations based on user input for:
- **Design Speed**: The maximum speed at which vehicles can safely travel.
- **Velocity**: The average speed of vehicles.
- **Road Deflection Angle**: The angle between the tangents of the curve.

Using standard geometric equations and highway design principles, the app outputs essential parameters:
- **Radius of the Curve**
- **Length of the Curve**
- **Tangent Distance**
- **Mid-Ordinate (Offset)**

These calculations ensure compliance with design safety standards.

## Input Parameters

1. **Design Speed (km/h or mph)**
2. **Road Deflection Angle (degrees)**
3. **Coefficient of Side Friction (if applicable)**
4. **Superelevation (optional)**
5. **Other relevant parameters based on the use case**

## Output

The app calculates and displays:

- **Radius (R)**
- **Curve Length (L)**
- **Tangent Length (T)**
- **External Distance (E)**
- **Mid-Ordinate (M)**

## How to Use

1. Open the application.
2. Enter the required input values in the respective fields.
3. Press the "Calculate" button.
4. View the calculated results displayed on the screen.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Dependencies**: MATLAB R2022a or more

## Installation

1. Download the application file (`App.mlapp`).
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the application on your system.

## Example Use Case

For a highway with:
- Design Speed: 80 km/h
- Deflection Angle: 30 degrees

The app calculates:
- Radius (R): 150 m
- Curve Length (L): 94.25 m
- Tangent Length (T): 80 m

These parameters can be used directly in highway design and construction.

## Future Features

- Integration with GIS tools for spatial data.
- Graphical visualization of the curve.
- Export options for saving results as PDF or CSV.
